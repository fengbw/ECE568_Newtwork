# Read me first!

There are two python files, and you need to run server.py first then run client.py. And remember to put all test.txt in same folder with python file so that python file can read it.

After run this two files, you can input command at client side.

## Here are a set of example commands:

Get test1.txt

Bounce anything

Exit

Exit anything

Other input will be treated as wrong command and be asked to input right command. Only EXIT command can shutdown the client.
